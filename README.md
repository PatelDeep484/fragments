Lab 1
There were a lot of things that i learned during this lab. Firstly talking about lint I need all the neccesary extension and I ahave to make sure that there are not any kind of errors in ,my code until now. running npm start was not that much of an issue but i have to make sure about the cross-env extenstion from now on and curl.env for curl commands which would be very frustrating if i dont remember it in the future.
